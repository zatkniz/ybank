# Test assignment for the ycode.com developer

This is my assignment for the ybank. I used docker for the services, nginx for the php server and mysql for the database. 

Node.js, Npm and Docker must be installed on your machine to run as expected.

# Installation Guide:
- open terminal
- git clone https://github.com/zatkniz/ybank.git
- cd ybank
- npm run init ( if you just clone the application ). This will install all dependencies and will start all the containers and finally will run the application. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/
- npm run start ( if you have allready installed the application ). Navigate to http://localhost:8000/

Thank you very much.
