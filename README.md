# Test assignment for the ycode.com developer

Hi! Are you ready to join our new team working on an innovative and exciting project? 
We are looking for a frontend, backend or full-stack developer. 
If you are not applying for a full-stack position, let us know and try to solve as much as you can.

For the test assignment, we have a partly finished banking application, where one account can send the money to the other. 
We need you to fix and finish it by paying attention to these factors:
 * **Security** - we do not want to be hacked
 * **Logic** - bank should not allow overspending your balance
 * **Best practices** - code should be clean and easy to maintain
 * **Tests** - test the parts that you feel necessary to

Use small commits and descriptive commit messages while working on the assignment. One commit solving one issue.

Authentication **IS NOT** in the scope of this assignment. Getting the transactions list with the request `GET /accounts/<id>/transactions` is not a security hole.

Use this repository as your starting point but **DO NOT** fork it. Create a public repository on GitHub for your application source code, push it and send a link to jobs@ycode.com.
